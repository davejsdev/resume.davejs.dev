# resume.davejs.dev

This is my resume built on Vite + React + TypeScript.

## Motivations

The goal of thi project is to demonstrate my software development skills and preferences by using web technologies I enjoy to build a small resume website. This project is intentionally over-engineered with excessive plugins, tools, and automation scripts. This setup is overkill for such a small project with just a single developer but would be useful in a growing project with several contributors.

## TODOs

While the end-product is functionally complete, there are a few things I'm like to add in terms of tooling:

- Storybook: for developing and testing different variants of components
- Playwright: for visual regression testing
- Stylelint: for ensuring CSS is clean (I'd especially like to lint for rational-ordering, which keeps properties with similar functionality grouped closely)
- bundlesize: I'd like to add bundlesize check for
